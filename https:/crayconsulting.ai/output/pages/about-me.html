    <p><strong><em>ABOUT</em></strong></p>
<p>I am a highly qualified technical expert in machine learning, artificial intelligence researcher, solutions architect, and strategy and technology consultant with over 25 yearsâ€™ commercial and technical experience in service-oriented and client-driven roles at the technology/business interface in software development, design of algorithms, product management and pre-sales engineering with a focus on machine learning system architecture, designing technical architecture solutions, and data science and business analytics across multiple verticals including banking, defence and telecoms. </p>
<p>I am an Oxford University physics graduate with a PhD in computational physics from the University of Salford and an MBA from Imperial College London. I am highly flexible and adaptable with the proven ability to work independently, and have undertaken many different client-facing technical and commercial roles for and with senior stakeholders at blue chips, SMEs, startups, government and third sector organizations, always committed to architecting, designing and implementing solutions that meet the needs and requirements of end users. </p>
<p>Most recently, I have been developing machine learning and artificial intelligence tools for APImetrics, where I focused on the practical challenge of working with our clients, including major banks, telecommunications carriers and global IT providers, to apply these novel techniques to the large volumes of data generated by our cloud computing-based real-time API monitoring and governance solution to understand API performance, especially as impacted by cloud infrastructure. </p>
<p>Machine learning models I developed included ones deploying both classic neural nets and Foundation Models.. They were created in Python in Jupyter Notebook and CoLab using tools including BigQuery, ChromaDB, LangChain, LlamaIndex pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn and TensorFlow. I fine-tuned Foundation Models with APImetrics data and built ML RAG pipelines that were integrated into the APImetrics SaaS platform with Docker hosted on Google Cloud infrastructure as part of my MLOps responsibilities. </p>
<p>My passion for AI  is lifelong. I believe AI has the capacity to transform the world and benefit every area of society profoundly. My communication skills and critical thinking skills, attention to detail, strategic focus and ability to articulate my passion for AI and cutting edge exponential technologies can be seen at my blog, https://atomicrazor.blogs.com. </p>
